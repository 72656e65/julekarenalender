Julekarenalender v2.0.0
=======================

Julekarenalender is a secret santa desktop application written in Java and Scala. It is adapted for the holidays, but can be used for any purpose that involves random drawing of winners. It is ideal for a project team or office with access to a TV connected with a computer.

Features:

* One-armed bandit style wheel with random winner draw
* Bonus wheel for custom purpose
* User management and winner tracking

The purpose of this project is to cooperate on writing code, learning Scala and migrate a desktop application from Java to Scala.

**Please note:** All active development takes place in the `develop` branch, which currently holds the in-development Scala version.
Stable releases are merged to [`master`](https://github.com/joakibj/julekarenalender/tree/master) and tagged. The development branch for the Java version of Julekarenalender can be found in the [`julekarenalender-java`](https://github.com/joakibj/julekarenalender/tree/julekarenalender-java) branch (This branch is **only** for bugfixes to the Java version).

The last stable release was v1.3.1 and [can be found here](https://github.com/joakibj/julekarenalender/releases/tag/v1.3.1).
